I was glad to give another talk via [Imperial Physics Undergraduate Colloquia](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/physics/students/current-students/undergraduates/community/colloquia/) to other undergraduate students about my work at [RIKEN](https://www.riken.jp/en/) and [University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/) on Density Functional Theory. [Slides available](../files/UGColloquia2023.pdf).
