I was honoured to present the work of my BSc thesis by a poster as the only undergraduate student at the [Dark Energy from Fundamental Theories to Observations Conference](https://agenda.infn.it/event/33387/page/7329-poster-contest) and be recognised by many active physicists from all over the world. [Poster available](../files/Poster2023).
