I was fortunate to be offered the opportunity by [Imperial Physics Undergraduate Colloquia](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/physics/students/current-students/undergraduates/community/colloquia/) to present my data analysis work with the CMS Heavy Ions group to other undergraduate colleagues who are also passionate about experimental particle physics! [Slides available](../files/UGColloquia2022.pdf).
